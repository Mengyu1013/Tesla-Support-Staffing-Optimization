# Tesla-Support-Staffing-Optimization
This project focuses on optimizing Tesla's support staffing model to handle technical and software-related customer calls efficiently. It integrates data-driven analysis to minimize operational costs while ensuring a high-quality customer experience, especially considering the multilingual and diverse demographics of Silicon Valley. The analysis addresses:

Hourly call forecasts and staffing strategies.
Cost minimization under operational constraints.
The potential impact of bilingual staffing.

Included Files:
Driving Innovations Optimization at Tesla.pdf: Case study documentation outlining the staffing challenges, constraints, and expected outcomes.
math-Final Project.R: R script for solving optimization problems using constrOptim.nl. The script includes models for different scenarios, such as bilingual staffing and constrained shifts, with detailed constraints and cost calculations.

This repository provides a practical example of operations research applied to a real-world scenario, showcasing advanced optimization techniques in customer service logistics.
